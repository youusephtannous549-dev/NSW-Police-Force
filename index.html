      <h2>Missing group located safe - Catherine Hill Bay</h2>
      <p class="date">Sunday, 17 August 2025 09:50:50 AM</p>
      <p>
        Four women who were reported as possibly missing after they were seen stranded on rocks at
        Catherine Hill Bay have been located safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        About 1.40pm (Saturday 16 August 2025), officers from Lake Macquarie Police District were called
        to rocks south of Catherine Hill Bay Beach, following reports four females were seen on the
        rocks about 1pm, before the tide came in and they could no longer be seen.
      </p>
      <p>
        A search operation commenced, including local police, officers from Marine Area Command, and
        the Westpac helicopter; however, the group could not be located.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following ongoing inquiries, including a public appeal for information, one of the four women
        contacted police and notified them that they were safe.
      </p>
      <p>Police would like to thank the public and media for their assistance.</p>
